README for XML Structure Validator
XML Structure Validator
Version: 1.0.0
XML Structure Validator is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built with Python's tkinter and lxml libraries to compare the structure of two XML files. It allows users to validate an XML file against a template XML file, ensuring they have matching tags, attributes, and content structures. The tool also supports batch validation of multiple XML files in a folder.

Features:
Single XML File Validation: Compare an XML file against a template XML file for structural consistency.
Batch Folder Validation: Validate all XML files in a selected folder against a template XML file.
Attribute and Content Comparison: Optionally check XML attributes and inner text values.
Logging: Logs validation results to a file (xml_validator.log) for easy tracking.
User-Friendly GUI: A simple interface for browsing files, setting options, and viewing results.
Drag-and-Drop Support (optional): Placeholder for drag-and-drop file selection (requires additional setup).

Prerequisites
To run the application, you'll need to install the following dependencies:
lxml

How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/xml-structure-validator.git
cd xml-structure-validator

Run the application:
python xml_validator.py

In the application window:
Use the Browse buttons to select the XML file to validate and the template XML file.
(Optional) Select the Check Attributes and Check Values checkboxes to include attributes and content in the comparison.
Click Validate XML to compare a single XML file or Validate Folder of XMLs to validate all XML files in a folder.
Validation results will be displayed in a message box and logged into xml_validator.log.


UI Components:
XML File Path: Select the XML file to validate.
Template XML File Path: Select the template XML file to compare against.
Check Attributes: Option to compare XML attributes (e.g., id="1").
Check Values: Option to compare inner text values between tags.
Validate XML: Button to validate the selected XML file.
Validate Folder of XMLs: Button to validate all XML files in a selected folder.
Progress Bar: Placeholder for displaying progress (especially useful for large files or folders).


Example Use Cases:
Validating XML data for a project against a specific template.
Ensuring multiple XML documents in a folder are structurally consistent with a standard.
Verifying XML attributes and text content where applicable.


Coming Features
The current version of XML Structure Validator (v1.0.0) offers basic and essential features for validating XML structures. We are planning to implement the following features in upcoming releases:
Progress Bar Integration: Full integration of the progress bar for long-running tasks, especially for batch validation of large XML files or folders.
Drag-and-Drop Support: Add complete drag-and-drop functionality for file selection using external libraries like tkinterdnd2.
XML Schema (XSD) Validation: Support for validating XML files against an XML Schema Definition (XSD) to ensure schema conformity.
Compressed File Handling: Add support for handling compressed XML files (e.g., .zip, .tar.gz).
Recursive Folder Validation: Allow validation of XML files in nested folders.
Save Report Functionality: Add a feature to save validation results to a file (text, CSV, or HTML).
XML Tree Visualization: Provide a feature to visualize the XML structure in a tree format.
Command-Line Interface (CLI): Add a command-line interface for users who prefer validating files through the terminal.
